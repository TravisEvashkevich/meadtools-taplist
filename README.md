# MeadTools Taplist Setup (Raspberry Pi)

This project powers the **MeadTools Taplist Display System**, a full-screen taplist for HDMI displays with local editing over Wi-Fi. You can install it two ways:

---

## üöÄ Option 1: Use the Prebuilt OS Image (Fastest)

Download the full Raspberry Pi OS image with everything preinstalled and ready to go.

**‚û°Ô∏è [Get the Latest Image Release](https://github.com/ljreaux/meadtools-taplist/releases)** (look for `MeadTools-Taplist.img.gz`)

### How to Flash the Image

1. Download the `.img.gz` file from the release
2. Flash it to a microSD card (16‚ÄØGB or larger) using:
   - [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
   - OR [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.io/)
3. Insert the card and boot your Raspberry Pi
4. The taplist display will launch automatically, and a Wi-Fi network named **Taplist Admin** will appear for editing

## üõ† Option 2: Install on Existing Raspberry Pi OS

Use this if you want to add the taplist to a Pi that‚Äôs already running Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm recommended).

### One-Line Install

Run this on your Raspberry Pi (connected to Ethernet or Wi-Fi):

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ljreaux/meadtools-taplist/main/pi/remote-setup.sh)
```

This will:

- Download setup files
- Install dependencies
- Set up the Flask server
- Configure autostart in kiosk mode
- Enable a Wi-Fi access point with captive portal

---

## ‚úÖ What This Setup Provides

- Fullscreen taplist on HDMI at boot
- Flask server at `localhost:5000`
- Admin panel via local Wi-Fi access point
- No internet connection required for editing
